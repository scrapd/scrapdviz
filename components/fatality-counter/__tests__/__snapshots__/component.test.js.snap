UPDATE: The APD Vehicular Homicide Unit is asking for anyone with information about the events leading up to the fatal November 11, 2017 crash on Research Blvd to contact them at (512) 974-6935 if they have not already done so.    
 
Original Narrative:
The preliminary investigation shows that 41-year-old Guy Brasted was driving a black, Jeep Wrangler northbound on Research Blvd., when he lost control, leaving the roadway and resulting in a head on collision with a White, Fiat 500, that was traveling southbound. A third vehicle sustained front-end damage from the continuation of the initial impact of the Jeep and Fiat.
	Brasted was ejected from his vehicle. Nancy Latulippe, 38, who was driving the Fiat, and passenger Jackson Latulippe, 14, were pronounced deceased at the scene.
	Two other passengers in the Fiat were transported to the hospital — an adult male with life-threatening injuries and a female child with non-life threatening injuries. The driver from the third vehicle was not transported for injuries.
	Brasted was initially transported to Dell Seton Medical Center with life-threatening injuries, but was later determined to be non-life threatening. He is facing two counts of intoxication manslaughter and one count of intoxication assault.
	This case is still being investigated.",
